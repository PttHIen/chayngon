871689348<end>243<end>30<end>It\'s Rafal here. I go to Penn and am Armin\'s friend. I have an interview for UBS S&amp;T coming up tomorrow. I was wondering if you know a good website to prep for probability and brain teasers Qs?<end>1476128897
1169410882<end>30<end>243<end>No specific website in mind. At least none that are free. Brain teasers: The more you see them the more comfortable you will be. The best thing to keep in mind is to always demonstrate your thought process and how you arrived to your conclusion. I could give you a few examples.Probability: that will come with your quantitive background. I believe reviewing quick mental math questions will help.Does this help? Let me know.<end>1476132233
1848175468<end>243<end>30<end>Ok, thank you. How about doing the ones at math stack exchange and quota?<end>1476132338
1163101029<end>30<end>243<end>Have you been doing those? They should help. It comes with practice.Honestly, I am not sure how UBS structures their interviews, but in addition to the quick math, the main other thing is showing why you want to do S&amp;T and personality. I didn\'t have any brain teasers or probability questions during my interview.<end>1476132503
1657870988<end>243<end>30<end>Ok, I\'m good on fit. I had a Barclays interview and they asked me probability in the end of my interview and that\'s when I didn\'t answer.<end>1476132570
324877228<end>243<end>30<end>Or answered incorrectly<end>1476132577
1183265691<end>30<end>243<end>Oh I see. What was the question if you remember.<end>1476132614
592798719<end>243<end>30<end>It was simple and I solved it after the interview but just stressed out and had the right logic however couldn\'t translate into numbers. How much would you pay for a game when you reroll a dice twice, which is 4.25<end>1476132677
1278976847<end>30<end>243<end>Gotcha<end>1476132731
